		<p>Traveling is fun. 
		Travel is good for lots of things, but it can also increase mental well-being - and not just in the short-term. 
		Whether youâ€™re traveling for business, on a one-week family holiday, or have sold everything to pursue a life on the road, 
		traveling can make you a happier person by building self-confidence, providing new experiences and memories, 
		breaking routine and allowing you to meet people from all over the world.</p>
		
		<p>These are the cities that I would like to visit someday.</p>
